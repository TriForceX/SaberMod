SaberMod
========

This is a *Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast* 1.04 mod targeting
competitive community. It is developed by *SaberMod team* (see
Authors_) and draws inspiration from all id Tech 3 based games and
mods, trying to improve on usability, stability and user experience
with *no-gimmicks* approach. Our first goal is reimplementing and
improving on the features of popular *league mod* by XycaleTh.

Source code is hosted on GitHub_ and based on `JK2 SDK GPL`_ - an
updated JK2 1.04 SDK.

g_infiniteAmmo 0
  Players spawn with infinite ammo for all weapons.

g_instagib 0
  Enable simple instagib mode for all weapons. Splash does no damage.

g_log[1-4] <filename>
  You can use 4 separate log files now.

  Filter events that should be printed in the dedicated server console
  or saved in the corresponding log file using following bit mask:

  TODO RELEASE

  See callvote_ nk and wk. `type` can be 0, 1 or 2.

g_restrictChat 0
  Prevent spectators from speaking to players and all clients from
  speaking to dueling players.

g_roundWarmup 10
  How many seconds players get to reposition themselves at the start
  of a round.

g_spawnShield 25
  Ammount of shield player gets on spawn.

g_teamForceBalance <number>
  Prevents players from joining the weaker team if difference

g_spawnItems 0
  What items will be given to players on spawn. Use following bitmask:

g_spawnWeapons 0
  Controls weapons given to players on spawn using the same bitmask
  as `g_weaponDisable`. The later cvar affects weapons and ammo
  spawned on a map, and if a game is considered saber-only. Setting
  this cvar to 0 restores original behaviour of `g_weaponDisable`.

roundlimit 0
  Number of rounds in a round-based match.

Round-based gametypes
.....................

In round-based gametypes players spawn with all available weapons and
items (controlled by `g_spawnWeapons` and `disable_*` cvars), however
there are no pickups on the map. Players gain one point for killing
an enemy and one point for each 50 damage dealt to enemy team. A round
lasts until either one team gets eliminated or a timelimit
is hit. Match ends when a roundlimit is hit.

Red Rover (g_gametype 9)
  It can be described as a FFA gametype with a twist. There are two
  teams, player who gets killed respawns in the opposing team. Round
  ends when one team gets eliminated, but the match winner is a person
  who scores most points.

Clan Arena (g_gametype 10)
  Player who dies must spectate until the end of a round.

Build
=====

Linux
-----

You will need GNU Make and GCC or Clang compiler. Type ``make`` to
build .so files in base/ and .qvm files in base/vm/ You can add
``-jN`` option to speed up the build process by running N jobs
simultaneously. Type ``make help`` to learn about other targets.

Assume your mod is called "mymod" and your main JK2 directory is
~/.jkii In order to test the mod, put .qvm files in ~/.jkii/mymod/vm/
and launch the game with ``+set fs_game mymod`` commandline parameter.

To debug your mod use generated .so files. Put them in ~/.jkii/mymod/
and launch the game with ``+set vm_game 0 +set vm_cgame 0 +set vm_ui
0`` commandline parameters. Set them back to 2 when you want to use
.qvm version again.

Windows
-------

Currently there is no support for building shared libraries on
Windows. Old ``code/buildvms.bat`` batch file should work for QVMs if
you can get lcc and q3asm tools (eg from *JK2 Editing Tools 2.0*) and
put them into bin/ directory.

I'll be glad to include Windows build scripts, project files etc. if
you can create and test them.
