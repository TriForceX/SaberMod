  of a round.

  ================  ================  ===============  ===============

g_spawnWeapons <bitmask>

  Controls weapons given to players on spawn using the same bitmask
  as `g_weaponDisable`. The later cvar affects only weapons and ammo
  spawned on a map. Setting this cvar to 0 restores original behaviour
  of `g_weaponDisable`.

g_unlagged <0|1>
  Experimental "unlagged" disruptor hit detection.

g_unlaggedMaxPing <msec>
  Maximum lag compensation. Unlagged has subjective, counter-intuitive
  side effects. For example a player can be hit some time after he hid
  behind an obstacle. This cvar's value limits time period in which
  this can happen, adding extra hit detection delay for players with
  pings higher than `msec`.

g_voteCooldown <seconds>
  How long a player has to wait before he can call another vote.

roundlimit <limit>
  Number of rounds in a round-based match.

Round-Based Gametypes
.....................

In round-based gametypes players spawn with all available weapons and
items (controlled by `g_spawnWeapons` and `g_spawnItems` cvars),
however there are no pickups on the map. Players gain one point for
killing an enemy and one point for each 50 damage dealt to the enemy
team. A round lasts until either one team is eliminated or a timelimit
is hit. Match ends when a roundlimit is hit.

Red Rover (g_gametype 9)
  It can be described as FFA with a twist. There are two teams, player
  who gets killed respawns in the opposing team. Round ends when one
  team is eliminated, but the match winner is a person who scores most
  points.

Clan Arena (g_gametype 10)
  Player who dies must spectate until the end of a round. When one
  team is eliminated, round is over. Team who hits the round limit
  first wins the match.

Server Modes
............

Server administrator can configure a number of custom game "modes",
players will be able to choose from. A mode is technically a config
file in `modes/` directory that will be executed when players
sucessfuly vote to use it. It can contain any commands altering server
behaviour, but please take following guides into consideration.

Switching to a mode from any other should always result in the same
server state. To achieve this it's best to use a "reset" config,
executed at the start of each mode config. It should contain a default
value for every possible cvar your modes are changing. Examine
included modes and `reset.cfg` as an example.

Other type of modes can change a specific rule instead of loading full
game config. For example one could create "Kicks On" mode that changes
g_kickMethod value to 1. In such scenario it's be best to also include
a mode reverting to original state: "Kicks Off", or reset affected
cvars in `reset.cfg`.

Server can be configured to go back to a default mode after a period
of inactivity. To do so last lines of the main server config should
resemble following template::

  set g_modeIdleTime "10"
  set g_modeDefault "mymode"
  exec "modes/mymode"
  map ffa_bespin

Where `mymode` is the default mode.

Build
=====

Linux
-----

You will need GNU Make and GCC or Clang compiler. Type ``make`` to
build .so files in base/ and .qvm files in base/vm/ You can add
``-jN`` option to speed up the build process by running N jobs
simultaneously. Type ``make help`` to learn about other targets.

Assume your mod is called "mymod" and your main JK2 directory is
~/.jkii In order to test the mod, put .qvm files in ~/.jkii/mymod/vm/
and launch the game with ``+set fs_game mymod`` commandline parameter.

To debug your mod use generated .so files. Put them in ~/.jkii/mymod/
and launch the game with ``+set vm_game 0 +set vm_cgame 0 +set vm_ui
0`` commandline parameters. Set them back to 2 when you want to use
.qvm version again.

Windows
-------

Currently there is no support for building shared libraries on
Windows. Old ``code/buildvms.bat`` batch file should work for QVMs if
you can get lcc and q3asm tools (eg from *JK2 Editing Tools 2.0*) and
put them into bin/ directory.

I'll be glad to include Windows build scripts, project files etc. if
you can create and test them.
